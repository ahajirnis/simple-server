# Reporting

## Context

Once we have the data, we need a way to analyze it, and derive meaningful data from it.
Nurses, medical officers, officials from Resolve and IHMI, and admins on Simple
will want to view vital information to track control of hypertension and adoption of the app.

### Kinds of reports
1. Admin/Web reports
    - Admins, CVHOs, STSes, and officials on Simple that have access to the admin dashboard see these reports.
    - They provide analyis of adoption, and usage of the app.
    - They also provide the registration and control data that came from the IHMI registries at facilities. 

2. Nurse/In-app reports
    - These are available inside the app for the nurses, MOs and officials at the facilities.
    - They generally include BP/registration/control data for that facility, over various periods of time.
    - They might also include a log of recent patients who visited the clinics.

3. Top-level/PDF reports
    - These are sent out every month, or quarter to officials, and have analysis at all levels.
    â€“ These might need subjective interpretations added to them, so they might be manually compiled. 

### Data and the scale

We should engineer for a realistic scale, with a potential to expand to the max scale. 

|Entity     | Realistic scale   | Max scale|
|-------    |-----------------  |----------|
| BP        |       1.2 billion | 6 billion |
| Patients |    100 million | 300 million |
| Users     |       20 k        | 100 k |
| Facilities |      10 k | 50 k |
| Drugs     |       1.2 billion | 6 billion | 

- BPs are the most populous entity, running into billions, within a few years.
- Patients are next, and they run into millions. They are also capped at the realistic 300m, based on the indian hypertensive population.

### Granularities

All these reports might be pulled at all these granularities:

#### By time
- Daily *
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Cohorts (9 month intervals)

Note that daily is the smallest time interval that matters for reports.

#### By territory
- User
- Facility
- District
- State
- Protocol
- Country

#### Other characteristics of reports
- Data for a date might change up to a few months from the date. The reports should account for this.
- BP, User, and Patient data can be aggregated daily.
- Control data can't be aggregated, and it should be regenerated from scratch every time.
- Computing reports needs to be idempotent.

## Decision

We'll go with a simple architecture, as described in the figure below:

![reporting-arch](../reporting-arch.png "Reporting architecture")

- We will use native postgres partitioning to slice the incoming data into multiple tables.
  Over time, each child table should have about 100m rows, not more.
- We will use a read replica database to run large queries, so that we don't impact the transactional database.
- Reporting code will be separated in code by one of the 2 ways:
  1. A separate namespace within the same rails codebase
  2. A separate service and repo altogether
- `/admin` and `/api` will continue to be the endpoints to retrieve these reports
- We will run batch jobs over a cron, or cron-like interface to compute reports.

### Performance
- We'll cache reports at the application level, and into the database for fine control
- Once we hit 10s of millions of BPs, we'll need to aggregate daily data for speed
